# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
### Background

I just landed a job as a data analyst at Pyber, a python-based ride share app company. I was asked to work with a team member at PyBer to perform exploratory analysis on data in large csv files. We were asked to develop several visualizations. We wereaable to tell a story about the data we worked with by creating charts and line graphs. 

Our overall goal in this development was to help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We were also able to create several visualizations showing information that better served Pyber in their future decision making. The Ride-sharing data included the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

### Purpose of the analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis was to show the summary of ride shareing data for each city type with the total fares for each. Showing this information shows or tells a story about each city type and how they may use or not use Pyber. With this information we are able to look at areas of improvement which will be explained in the summary. 
After completing the first assignment I was then asked to break down the analysis to use my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary  of the ride-sharing data by each city type. There are three different city types. They are, Rural, Suburban, and Urban. After I did this, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 



## Results 
The folloing are some visulations that help see the data results more clearly first being a data frame showing fare for each weeek for specific city type.

The Lines on the graph represent each city type as referenced by the Legend. 
Y-axis represents Total Fares ($USD) while the X-axis represents each month(weekly) data was analyzed. Different colors were used to make it easier to differentiate how each city type performed.

### Description of the differences in ride-sharing data amoung each city type. 

- Urban
    Total Rides: Urban hhas the highest amount of rides with suburban next and rural coming in last. 
    Total Fares: Had the most fares in comparison with Suburban and Rural. 
    Average Fare per driver: The average fare per urban driver is higher than Suburban and Rural. 
    Average Fare per ride: Urban had the lowest avgerage fare price,
- Rural 
    Total Rides: Rural had the lowest amount of ride shares. 
    Total Fares: Rural had the lowest avg fare price.
    Average Fare per driver: The average fare per rural driver is lowest in comparison with Rural and Suburban. 
    Average Fare per ride: Rural had the highest average fare price.

-Suburban
   Total Rides: Suburban fell inbetween the Urban and Rural with total ride count. 
   Total Fares: Suburban also feel in the middle of Urban and Rural for Total Fares. 
   Average Fare per driver:The average fare per suburban driver is lower than Urban but higher than Rural. 
   Average Fare per ride: Suburban had an average fare price that was higher than Urban but lower than Rural. 

## Summary

To summarize the data from this analysis we see in this data   I see that Urban cities come out on top with making the most revenue for PyBer. I see also that between Februrary and March there is an increase in Pyber use for all three city types. Something to definetly look into. Is it some sort of tourist popular time etc.. I see many differences that should be looked at to help rural and suburban cities become more productive. I would have three business recomendations to the CEO of Pyber. I would look at what is causing the decrease in March for all cities and see how that plays a role in lack of revenue. 

Based on the results I have three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types the first would be to capitilize on and increase the Urban city fare prices knowing because Urban has the highest percentage of rides, Second, I woould look at lowering  fare prices in the rural areas to make it more affordable for people to use and Third, I would look at  ld recommend hiring more drivers in the rural and suburban areas. This cold produce more revenue for these areas and increase the amount of rides.
