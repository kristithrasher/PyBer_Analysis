# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

I just landed a job as a data analyst at Pyber, a python-based ride share app company. I was asked to work with a team member at PyBer to perform exploratory analysis on data in large csv files. We were asked to develop several visualizations. We wereaable to tell a story about the data we worked with by creating charts and line graphs. 

Our overall goal in this development was to help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We were also able to create several visualizations showing information that better served Pyber in their future decision making. The Ride-sharing data included the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

After completing the first assignment I was then asked to break down the analysis to use my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary  of the ride-sharing data by each city type. There are three different city types. They are, Rural, Suburban, and Urban. After I did this, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 



## Results 
The folloing are some visulations that help see the data results more clearly first being a data frame showing fare for each weeek for specific city type.

We see in this data frame how the fare is much higher in the Urban Cities vs Rural Cities and Suburban Cities are somewhere int he middle. 


The Lines on the graph represent each city type as referenced by the Legend. 
Y-axis represents Total Fares ($USD) while the X-axis represents each month(weekly) data was analyzed. Different colors were used to make it easier to differentiate how each city type performed.

There are some differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. I will break down these differences by City Type.
  - Rural city types had the lowest fare prices out of the three city types. 
    
  - Suburban cities had fare prices that were lower than Urban cities but higher than Rural cities.
  
  - Urban cities had the highest amount in fares generating the most rides and total fares by much greater amount. 


## Summary

To summarize the data from this analysis we see in this data frame how the fare is much higher in the Urban Cities vs Rural Cities and Suburban Cities are somewhere int he middle.We should look to see what is cuasing the decrease in fares for the month of March. 
Based on the results I have three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types the first would be to capitilize on and increase the Urban city fare prices knowing because Urban has the highest percentage of rides, second, I would lower the fare prices in the rural areas to make it more affordable for people to use and finally I would recommend hiring more drivers in the rural and suburban areas
