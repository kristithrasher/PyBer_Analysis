# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

I just landed a job as a data analyst at PyBer..a python based ride share app company. I was asked to work with a teammember at PyBer to perform exploratory analysis on data in large csv files. We were asked to develop several visualizations and were able to tell a story about the data we worked with. Our overall goal in this development is to help Pyber improve acess to ride sharing services and determine affodabiltiy for under served neighborhoods. We were able to create several visualations showing information that better served Pyber in their future decision making. The Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

After completing the first assighnment I was asked to break down the analysis to use my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary  of the ride-sharing data by each city type. There are three different city types. They are, Rural, Suburban, and Urban. After we did this we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 




## Results

There are some differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. I will break down thesed differences by City Type.
  - Rural city types had the lowest fare prices out of the three city types. 
  - Remained consistent in pricing throughout the year. 

  - Suburban cities had fare prices tht were lower than Urban cities but higher than Rural cities.


  - Urban cities had the highest amount in fares. 


## Summary

Based on the results, 
three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
